Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their application across various domains; however, their performance in complex medical reasoning tasks remains limited. We introduces a Multi-Planners Plan-and-Solve (MPPS) framework that employs multiple interacting planners to collaboratively refine the reasoning process. Through structured interactions and self-correction, our approach reduces variability and mitigates hallucinations and logical inconsistencies, commonly observed in single-planner setups. Extensive experiments conducted on the MedQA dataset demonstrate that the multi-planner framework achieves notable improvements, with GPT-3.5-Turbo's accuracy increasing from 27.7% in single-planner mode to 72% in the multi-planner setup, Command-R-Plus improving from 48.5% to 78.5%, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet increasing from 43.5% to 76.67%. These results illustrate the potential of multi-planner strategies in enhancing the robustness, accuracy, and interpretability of AI-driven decision-making systems in medicine.

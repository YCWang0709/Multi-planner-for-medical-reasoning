**Recent advancements in large language models**

**(LLMs) have significantly improved their application across**

**various domains; however, their performance in complex med**

**ical reasoning tasks remains limited. We introduces a Multi**

**Planners Plan-and-Solve (MPPS) framework that employs mul**

**tiple interacting planners to collaboratively refine the reasoning**

**process. Through structured interactions and self-correction,**

**our approach reduces variability and mitigates hallucinations**

**and logical inconsistencies, commonly observed in single-planner**

**setups. Extensive experiments conducted on the MedQA dataset**

**demonstrate that the multi-planner framework achieves notable**

**improvements, with GPT-3.5-Turbo’s accuracy increasing from**

**27.7% in single-planner mode to 72% in the multi-planner**

**setup, Command-R-Plus improving from 48.5% to 78.5%, and**

**Claude 3.5 Sonnet increasing from 43.5% to 76.67%. These**

**results illustrate the potential of multi-planner strategies in**

**enhancing the robustness, accuracy, and interpretability of AI**

**driven decision-making systems in medicine.**
